In this blog post, I'll be sharing my experience with the GitHub Foundations exam, detailing how to schedule, prepare for, and successfully pass it.

## About GitHub Foundations Certification

According to GitHub, this exam covers understanding GitHub platform fundamental concepts, products of GitHub, and concepts of collaborating, contributing, and working on GitHub.

It covers the following domains:

- Domain 1: Introduction to Git and GitHub (10%)

## Scheduling the Exam

To register and schedule the exam, visit the [Official Exam Website](https://examregistration.github.com/login?ReturnUrl=%2Foverview) and log in with your GitHub account. Then, select the GitHub Foundation Exam.

Once you've completed these steps, you'll receive an email from PSI Online containing your exam date, time, and important instructions. Make sure to read through them carefully.

## Preparing for the Exam

Preparation is key for exams and certifications. It includes planning, understanding the exam content, and dedicating focused study time. Remember to **Avoid Relying on Exam Dumps**, as they don't guarantee success. Embrace the process of studying and expanding your knowledge.

For effective preparation, leverage resources such as the [GitHub Foundations learning path on MS Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/collections/o1njfe825p602p) and the official [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en), along with other learning and training sources.

Additionally, GitHub and Microsoft are launching the new GitHub Foundations livestream series! From March 27th to April 16th, [Register Now](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/series/s-1298/?WT.mc_id=academic-128170-alfredodeza).

![Livestream Sessions](/assets/img/github-foundation-exam/live-sessions.png)
