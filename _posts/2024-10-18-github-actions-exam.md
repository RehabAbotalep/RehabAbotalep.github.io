Earlier this year (2024), GitHub shared some exciting news: certifications that were once only for their employees and partners are now open to everyone worldwide!

These certifications cover different skills and knowledge areas related to GitHub:

- GitHub Foundations
- GitHub Actions
- GitHub Advanced Security
- GitHub Administration

In this blog post, I'll be sharing my experience with the GitHub Actions exam, detailing how to schedule, prepare for, and successfully pass it.

## About GitHub Actions Certification

According to GitHub, This exam is designed for DevOps engineers, software developers, and IT professionals with intermediate level experience in GitHub Actions, including workflow creation, automation, and CI/CD pipeline
management.

It covers the following domains:

- Domain 1: Author and maintain workflows (40%)
- Domain 2: Consume workflows (20%)
- Domain 3: Author and maintain actions (25%)
- Domain 4: Manage GitHub Actions for the enterprise (15%)

For more details, checkout [Study Guide for GitHub Actions](https://assets.ctfassets.net/wfutmusr1t3h/2mMJ6nECbUAdiQMTObbPw6/275fd49301e7a0d1b4e3de0bfe95d765/github-actions-exam-preparation-study-guide__1_.pdf).

## Preparing for the Exam

Preparation is key for exams and certifications. It includes planning, understanding the exam content, and dedicating focused study time. Remember to **Avoid Relying on Exam Dumps**, as they don't guarantee success. Embrace the process of studying and expanding your knowledge.

For effective preparation, leverage resources such as the [GitHub Actions learning path on MS Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/collections/n5p4a5z7keznp5) and the official [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en), along with other learning and training sources.

Personally, I found both the MS Learning path and GitHub documentation to be valuable resources for my preparation.

## Hands-On

After getting a solid foundation of GitHub Actions, it's really important to follow it with hands-on exercises.

To help with that, I created the following repository in GitHub that has a collection of GitHub Actions and workflows to demonstrate various features and capabilities of GitHub Actions. It includes examples of workflows, composite actions, Docker-based actions, and JavaScript-based actions.

Check it out: [learning-github-actions](https://github.com/RehabAbotalep/learning-github-actions)

![Repo](/assets/img/github-actions-exam/github-actions-repo.png)

Additionally, I’ve written a blog post that outlines a step by step guide to build and deploy an .Net Core application to an Azure App Service using GitHub Actions.

Check it out: [GitHub Actions: Deploying .NET to Azure App Service](https://rehababotalep.github.io/posts/delpoy-.net-to-azure-app-service/)

## Taking the Exam (Proctored at Home)

It's important to sign in up to 30 minutes before your test start time as per the instructions provided when booking your exam. Ensure you adhere to the technical requirements and have a valid, current ID ready. The name on this ID must be in Roman (English) alphabet characters and must match the name used when scheduling the exam.

The exam has around 75 questions, and you have 120 minutes to finish it. Once you're done, you'll know right away if you passed or failed.
 

## After The Exam

Immediately after completing your exam, you'll receive an email containing a detailed score report. This report will outline your overall score and the percentage scores for each exam module. It will help you pinpoint areas of strength and areas that may require improvement.

Additionally, you'll receive a Credly badge that you can share on your social media profiles such as LinkedIn, Twitter, your website, and other platforms. This badge serves as recognition of your achievement and allows you to showcase your skills to others.
